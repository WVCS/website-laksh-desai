    Welcome to my website! I’m Laksh, a student passionate about math and coding. I love exploring complex mathematical concepts and unique coding projects. 
    Currently, I'm learning about calculus, linear algebra, and machine learning. I am aiming to solve real-world problems and push the boundaries of technology. 
    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, going to the beach, and learning how to play tennis. 
    You can look through my website to find other fun sites or explore some of my project from AP CSP!!!
